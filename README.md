## Description

This app is all about eating burgers, yes, that's right! You'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

•	Enter a burger name into the app to add it.  Make custom burgers or burgers you have enjoyed in the past.
    o	Burger name will be added to the "Burgers Available for Eating" section of the page.
•	Select a burger you would like to Devour from the " Burgers Available for Eating".
    o	Burger will be moved to the "Burgers That Are Devoured" section of the page.
•	After the burger has been Devoured, you can trash the wrapper and crumbs by selecting the Trash button
    o	Burger will be removed from the page
