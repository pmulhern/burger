## Description

This app is all about eating burgers! It features a full stack burger logger leveraging MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It also follows MVC design patterns and uses Node/ MySQL to query and route data as well as Handlebars to generate HTML.

Funtionality:

•	Enter a burger name into the app to add it.  Make custom burgers or burgers you have enjoyed in the past.
Burger name will be added to the "Burgers Available for Eating" section of the page.

•	Select a burger you would like to Devour from the " Burgers Available for Eating".  Burger will be moved to the "Burgers That Are Devoured" section of the page.

•	After the burger has been Devoured, you can trash the wrapper and crumbs by selecting the Trash button.  Burger will be removed from the page
